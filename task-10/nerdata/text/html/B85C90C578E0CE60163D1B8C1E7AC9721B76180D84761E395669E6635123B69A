><br>
<p><strong>1.  POLICY </strong></p>
<p>a.  It is NASA's policy, consistent with statutory requirements, to promote the  transfer and commercial utilization of inventions arising from NASA-supported  research or development in which NASA has an ownership interest by the  licensing of such inventions. Accordingly, NASA maintains a Technology Transfer  Program that ensures Agency processes are in place to protect intellectual  property and transfer these assets in a manner that provides clear benefits for  the Agency, the domestic economy, and the research community. A key element of  this activity is the licensing of NASA inventions. <br>
<p>b.  The following principles will be applied to accomplish the policy objectives  set forth above:<br>
<p>(1)  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 207, "Domestic and Foreign Protection of Federally Owned  Inventions," Federal agencies are authorized to grant exclusive, partially  exclusive, or nonexclusive licenses on Federally owned inventions. The term  &quot;invention&quot; means any invention or discovery which is or may be  patentable or otherwise protectable under Title 35 U.S.C., or any novel variety  of plant which is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act. <br>
<p>(2)  No license will be granted to a potential licensee who has not provided NASA  with a plan for development and/or marketing of the invention at issue.<br>
<p>(3)  Preference will be given to a potential licensee who agrees that any products  embodying the invention or produced through the use of the invention at issue  will be manufactured substantially in the United States.<br>
<p>(4)  An exclusive or partially exclusive license will only be granted when all the  following conditions are met:<br>
<p>(a)  Granting the license is a reasonable and necessary incentive to call forth the  investment capital and expenditures needed to bring the invention to practical  application, or otherwise promote the invention's utilization by the public.<br>
<p>(b)  A finding is made by NASA that the public will be served by the granting of the  license, as indicated by the potential licensee's intentions, plans, and  ability to bring the invention to practical application or otherwise promote  the invention's utilization by the public, and that the proposed scope of  exclusivity is not greater than reasonably necessary to provide the incentive for  bringing the invention to practical application, as proposed by the potential  licensee, or otherwise promote the invention's utilization by the public.<br>
<p>(c)  The potential licensee makes a commitment to achieve practical application of  the invention within a reasonable time, which time may be extended by NASA upon  the potential licensee's request, and the potential licensee's demonstration  that the refusal of such extension would be unreasonable.<br>
<p>(d)  Granting the license will not tend to substantially lessen competition or  result in a violation of the Federal antitrust laws.<br>
<p>(e)  In the case of an invention covered by a foreign patent application or patent,  the interests of the Federal Government or United States industry in foreign  commerce will be enhanced. <br>
<p>(5)  In negotiating terms for any license granted pursuant to this directive, terms  should be negotiated that provide the licensee incentive to commercialize the  invention. In the case of exclusive or partially exclusive licenses, such terms  shall not tend to substantially lessen competition or create or maintain a  violation of Federal antitrust laws.<br>
<p>(6)  In no case shall a NASA Center negotiate or enter into a license agreement  without the involvement of both the Chief Technologist, or designee(s) within  Headquarters and at the Centers, as prescribed by paragraph 5b of this  directive, and the General Counsel, or designee(s) (the Agency Counsel for  Intellectual Property or Center Patent/Intellectual Property Counsel), as  prescribed by paragraph 5c of this directive.<br>
<p>(7)  The NASA model license agreement template, as discussed further in paragraph 5c  of this directive, shall, to the extent practicable, be employed in negotiation  of all license agreements. To the maximum extent practicable, NASA negotiates  license agreements to include uniform terms across Centers. <br>
</p>
  <strong>2.  APPLICABILITY </strong><br>
<p>a.  This NASA Policy Directive (NPD) is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA  Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support  Centers. This language applies to JPL, other contractors, grant recipients, or  parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the  appropriate contracts, grants, or agreements. <br>
<p>b.  In this directive, all mandatory actions (i.e.,  requirements) are denoted by statements containing the term &quot;shall.&quot;  The terms &quot;may&quot; or &quot;can&quot; denote discretionary privilege or  permission, &quot;should&quot; denotes a good practice and is recommended but  not required, &quot;will&quot; denotes expected outcome, and &quot;are/is&quot;  denotes descriptive material. <br>
