			<p><em>In today’s A Lab Aloft International Space Station Chief Scientist Julie Robinson, Ph.D., looks back on 2014 to highlight some of the year’s milestones and research achievements.</em></p>
<p>As I take a moment to reflect on the accomplishments of the past 12 months, I can’t help but think of how they relate to where we’re going next with the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html#.VFfIdBAnm8A">International Space Station</a>. From the crew capabilities to research goals, from NASA’s plans for continued exploration to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/benefits/index.html#.VMew6GMkSSo">benefits for humanity</a> from station studies, there are some key areas that stand out from 2014.</p>
<div id="attachment_894" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2015/01/2014-blog_A_ISS-Crew-Expedition-41.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-894" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2015/01/2014-blog_A_ISS-Crew-Expedition-41-300x200.jpg" alt="Expedition 41 crew portrait on the International Space Station. From left: ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst, Roscosmos cosmonauts Elena Serova, Maxim Suraev and Alexander Samokutyaev, and NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman and Barry Wilmore.

<p>During the last year there has been so much demand for research on the space station—including investigations that require crew time—planners really have had to push the schedule. We deferred some preventative maintenance, scaling back on some filter changes, for instance, to adjust operations for increased crew time for research. That’s allowed us to get as much as 47 hours a week averaged in a six-month period. This number is the total for the three U.S. astronauts, rather than the original standard of 35 hours for science. When you think about it, that’s almost half again as much research as the designed schedule.</p>
<p>This is a great performance of balancing time aboard station, though we won’t always be able to hold to that. This is why we still need to go to seven crew members. The crew dedicating time to tend to investigations helps us to optimize the research coming out of space station, as well. Currently we house six crew members in orbit aboard the space station, and some of you may know that this is one person short of the craft’s design to sleep seven. This is because our Soyuz “lifeboat” can only return six crew members in an emergency. The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html#.VFDyaRAnm8A">advent of commercial crew</a> will allow us to expand by that extra crew member, as the new vehicles can ferry four. This is a future goal that we all look forward to:  a full house.</p>
<p>The crew was particularly busy during the latter part of 2014 with a huge <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/rodent_research/">new capability</a> for biological research using model animals. This also was driven by user demand to launch rodents—meaning mice and rats, though so far we’re starting with mice on the space station. We now have a system that can launch rodents aboard the SpaceX Dragon vehicle. The animals can live aboard station for a long period of time in special habitats, and then either be processed on orbit or eventually returned live. This system was important to get online this year, because we had a large number of users in medical research and pharmaceuticals interested in using space station as a test bed for their studies.</p>
<div id="attachment_895" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2015/01/2014-blog_B_Butch-Wilmore.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-895" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2015/01/2014-blog_B_Butch-Wilmore-300x199.jpg" alt="NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore setting up the Rodent Reseach-1 Hardware in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) aboard the International Space Station.

<p>There are many discoveries that have affected human health that were dependent on the use of animals as what we call “<a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/11/13/model-organisms-shining-examples-for-simple-effective-biology-research/">model organisms</a>,” from the discovery of insulin to the that of tamoxifen to treat breast cancer to kidney transplants. This doesn’t mean these organisms are going to grace the cover of a magazine, but rather that they provide a model for humans to help us understand disease processes. By watching how they respond to research, we can in turn learn how to fight those diseases.</p>
<div id="attachment_896" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2015/01/2014-blog_c_Model-Organisms.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-896" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2015/01/2014-blog_c_Model-Organisms-300x168.jpg" alt="The use of model organisms in laboratories on Earth and aboard the International Space Station can lead to insights for researchers into human health.

<p>Having the ability to fly mice to space for long-duration studies is a huge advance. Fulfilling this capability was our response to the <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13048">Decadal Survey</a> recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. We have years of research already lined up hoping to get access to these mice. To optimize the potential for discovery, we combine as many experiments together on this precious resource as possible.</p>
<p>This is an exciting area of study, as just a handful of mice have flown in the past—both on space station assembly flights and one flight in a system called mice drawer system. Even so, those findings account for a significant number of our highest profile publications from space station research. With access twice per year, we now have this type of study as a routine capability. This means we can expect to see a huge ramp-up in high-impact research in biomedical areas.</p>
<p>Another big change this year has been the space station maturing as a platform for Earth science. My colleagues in <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/">Earth sciences at NASA</a> have called this <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/earth-right-now/#.VFf4xxAnm8A">the year of the Earth</a>, because they’ve had five related instruments go into space this year. That’s a record, and two of these are on the space station, a first!</p>
<div id="attachment_721" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2013/12/Remote-Sensing_RapidScat-artist-rendering_G.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-721" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2013/12/Remote-Sensing_RapidScat-artist-rendering_G-300x168.jpg" alt="Artist's rendering of NASA's ISS-RapidScat instrument (inset), which launched to the International Space Station in 2014 to measure ocean surface wind speed and direction and help improve weather forecasts, including hurricane monitoring.

<p>Moving forward we’re going to see <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/external_instruments/">a couple instruments a year go up</a> until the space station&#8217;s current external sites are primarily full, likely in 2017. We now need to study whether to grow our capabilities to support more Earth sciences instruments, as well as astrophysics and heliophysics studies.</p>
<p>It’s really thrilling to see these initial instruments come to station and begin operations right off the bat. The first of these, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1067.html">ISS-RapidScat</a>, was bringing hurricane data home within three hours—this was less than a week after installation. The instrument measured the sea-surface winds and was used to look at <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4337">Typhoon Vongfong</a> in Japan. How quickly scientists can use these data and incorporate findings into use for us on the ground can provide real benefits. The results can give valuable information that people need to know to protect their lives and property, making it an important advance to have available aboard station.</p>
<p>Next is the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1037.html">CATS</a>), an imager that looks at clouds and aerosols for climate research. CATS will be followed by a number of instruments that are either brand new to science or that <a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/12/06/the-sense-in-earth-remote-sensing-from-the-international-space-station/">fill a gap from similar satellites</a> to provide cross calibration. Our understanding of the Earth is going to improve thanks to the research from all of these instruments.</p>

<p>One of the areas that congress has encouraged us to pursue is the development of commercial applications and commercial research on the space station. To this end, they declared the space station U.S. segment a national laboratory in 2005. In 2011 we selected <a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/">CASIS</a>, the Center for Advancement of Science in Space, to manage that national lab side for use by researchers that are not funded by NASA. These scientists may be funded by other government agencies or the private sector or nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>This year CASIS grew substantially with the advent of their <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/ark1/">ARK-1</a> and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/casis_spacex4/">ARK-2</a> suites of investigations aboard station. Also in 2014, the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) investigator of the space station national lab era launched her <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/T_Cell/">immunology research study</a>. There are other NIH studies to come, including one that looks at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/NIH_Hammer.html">bone loss</a>. CASIS also brought large initiatives in <a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/NewsEvents/PressReleases/tabid/111/ArticleID/66/ArtMID/586/CASIS-Announces-Latest-Funded-Project-for-Protein-Crystallization-in-Microgravity.aspx">protein crystal growth</a>, <a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/NewsEvents/PressReleases/tabid/111/ArticleID/150/ArtMID/586/CASIS-Issues-Solicitation-for-Proposals-Focused-On-Earth-Observation-to-Benefit-Energy-Technology-From-the-International-Space-Station.aspx">Earth sciences</a>, <a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/newsevents/pressreleases/tabid/111/articleid/91/artmid/586/casis-announces-grant-awards-for-stem-cell-research.aspx">stem cells</a> and <a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/NewsEvents/PressReleases/tabid/111/ArticleID/61/ArtMID/586/CASIS-Announces-Grant-Awards-for-Materials-Science.aspx">materials science</a> to continue to advance commercial research aboard the space station.</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Brian Talbot, marketing and communications director with CASIS, and he shared his thoughts with me on the <a href="http://ww2.iss-casis.org/e/51802/Annual-Report-2014/297q6/14864347">accomplishments of the organization for the past year</a>. “The continued growth of CASIS as an organization in 2014 speaks to the limitless opportunities commercial and academic researchers see aboard the space station. Through funded solicitations in proven areas of space-based research to innovative and non-traditional commercial users, CASIS is moving ever closer towards its goal of fully utilizing of the national lab for Earth-benefit inquiry.”</p>
<p>When I talked about crew time, you may have noticed that it was broken down by U.S. and Russian segments and crew members. While this division is useful for tracking purposes, it’s important to mention how we are blurring those boundaries. This international laboratory brings collaborations together through research that transcend relations on the ground. The space station exemplifies a global partnership at its best.</p>
<p>One thing that has driven us to continue advancing our partnership is the announcement of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/index.html">joint one-year expedition</a>. Since the 2013 announcement, we have made advances in finalizing our <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/stepping-stones-to-human-missions-beyond/">research goals</a> in preparation for the 2015 launch. This extended expedition will have an astronaut and a cosmonaut both stay aboard the space station for 12 months, instead of the current six-month standard. It’s been decades since astronauts were in space that long. With the leaps in our medical technology, the one-year stay will help us to better understand what happens to the human body on long-duration flights. These studies also may help answer related concerns for health here on Earth.</p>

<p>I’m really excited about how that <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html#.VFoihGNNeRM">international collaboration</a> across all of our partners has evolved. We’re combining more investigations, we’re releasing open data for the entire global scientific community to work with and we’re joining crew member resources to optimize all of these activities. Whether it’s microbial sampling, taking care of plants or making specific observations of the human body, our crew members are working together on what is truly an international station in space.</p>
<p>Early this year, John Holdren, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Obama administration, announced their support of <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2024extension/">extending the space station to 2024</a>. We have worked through the impacts that this has for space station research and this extension gives us 90 percent more external research and close to 50 percent more pressurized research—those studies taking place in the cabin. 2024 is very important to what we can achieve with this global microgravity resource of the space station.</p>
<p>When we have scientists already in line wanting to do investigations, having more time to get those studies done and even to do follow-on research opens up the discovery potential. This also provides more time for research markets to develop independently. Just like on the ground, when someone wants to study a certain area, they contract a lab to do the experiments. Someday, when space station is gone, we want scientists to have continued access through this emerging market of microgravity research in space. This longer duration for station to remain as a platform helps to open up those opportunities for researchers around the world. This is the world’s chance to continue the mission of discovery off the Earth for the Earth.</p>

			<p><em>In today’s A Lab Aloft we hear from William Wells Jr., aSTEAM Village SSEP Kansas City program director, as he shares the difference made in the lives of students when schools work together to support education opportunities. These students literally reach for the stars with the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program when they send their studies to the International Space Station.</em></p>
<p>Many U.S. students lack foundational skills and knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM, or with art added STEAM) as a result of the absence of authentic learning activities in STEM subjects. They have little to no exposure to highly competent role models in STEM fields and limited opportunities to think critically, solve problems, research, publish and hypothesize.</p>
<p>Through the Student Spaceflight Experiment Program (<a href="http://ssep.ncesse.org/">SSEP</a>), which is led by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education (<a href="http://ncesse.org/">NCESSE</a>), <a href="http://www.bbchartertech.org">Benjamin Banneker Charter Academy of Technology</a> in Kansas City, Missouri, engaged with other public and private school districts through <a href="http://www.asteamvillage.org">aSTEAM Village</a>, and I am honored to serve as the SSEP Kansas City program director. I work to fulfill the aSTEAM Village mission of helping to level the playing field for students in the Kansas City area. Our goal is to ensure all students are exposed to 21<sup>st</sup>-century knowledge through an expanded learning strategy in before/after-school and regular classroom environments using STEAM curriculum.</p>

<p>Through this in-depth program, our community’s students are presented an opportunity to be immersed in a high-profile community science competition. The objective is for students to submit an experiment that they hope will be selected to ferry to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/">International Space Station</a>. Aboard the orbiting laboratory astronauts will perform the student experiment in microgravity. Meanwhile, the students conduct the ground truth of the study here on Earth. This is a real space program and not a simulation!</p>
<div id="attachment_876" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/12/SSEP_Luca.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-876" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/12/SSEP_Luca-300x199.jpg" alt="Astronaut Luca Parmitano getting ready to activate specific SSEP mini-labs aboard the International Space Station.

<p>I was speaking recently with Marian Brown, Ed.D., superintendent for Benjamin Banneker Charter Academy of Technology, who shared with me the difference she has noticed in students attending aSTEAM Village partner schools through their participation with SSEP.</p>
<p>“We are so pleased that teachers and mentors have embraced the struggle to immerse and engage students in every facet of real science to ensure all students are provided the chance to explore the scientific method, as well as experience science firsthand. More importantly, we have observed an increase in our students&#8217; capacity for hard work, perseverance and resilience. In addition, this program and partnership will help alter the path of children’s lives by fostering creative thinking, real-world problem-solving and true innovation for urban revitalization.”</p>
<p>I was not surprised that Dr. Brown’s thoughts were echoed in a conversation I recently had with Kristen Marriott, a middle school STEM teacher who has been involved with SSEP in three missions at two different aSTEAM Village partner schools: <a href="http://www.dellalamb.org">Della Lamb</a> and <a href="http://www.crossroadsacademykc.org">Crossroads Academy</a>. Marriott believes that the best thing about the program is watching the students problem solve and work collaboratively.</p>
<p>“They start the project as individuals but end up as a group, working through difficulties and limitations together. I have been amazed with the variety of experiments the students have proposed. We truly have a generation of STEM leaders making their way through school at this time.”</p>
<div id="attachment_878" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/12/SSEP_Eamon-and-Nicole-with-Astronaut-Dr.-Don-Thomas1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-878 size-medium" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/12/SSEP_Eamon-and-Nicole-with-Astronaut-Dr.-Don-Thomas1-225x300.jpg" alt="Eamon Shaw and Nicole Ficklin with astronaut Dr. Don Thomas at the NCESSE National Conference (Lisa Shaw)" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eamon Shaw and Nicole Ficklin with astronaut Dr. Don Thomas at the NCESSE National Conference. (Lisa Shaw)</p></div>
<p>I think it’s safe to say there is plenty of evidence to support Marriott’s assertion. Two teams from another aSTEAM Village community partner, <a href="http://www.stpeterskc.org">St. Peter’s School</a>, had two flights selected, <a href="http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-5-to-iss/">Mission 5</a> and <a href="http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-6-to-iss/">Mission 6</a>, which Robert J. Jacobsen, the school’s science teacher and SSEP coordinator said, “provided not only St. Peter’s, but the Kansas City community, a sense of achievement and pride.”</p>
<p>It has been fun watching the students reap the rewards of their diligent work and effort, from brainstorming and proposing ideas to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2014_ssep_conference/">presenting their projects</a> at the NCESSE 2014 <a href="http://ssep.ncesse.org/national-conference/">National SSEP Conference</a> in Washington. The student researchers, grades 5-8, discovered the need to be flexible yet manage their time and energy. They learned to value review boards, both at the local and national level, and the important input that they had to offer. The student teams also mastered answering questions from the media (and what a wonderful job they have done). We have seen the enthusiasm of the student teams involved with both Missions 5 and 6 act as a motivating force for the <a href="http://ssep.ncesse.org/current-flight-opportunities/ssep-mission-7-to-the-international-space-station-iss/">Mission 7</a> teams who have just completed their proposals to be evaluated by the local review board.</p>
<p>Through mostly local funding, SSEP also provided the opportunity for the Mission 5 finalists and first-time SSEP participants from the Kansas City area to get a life-altering VIP tour of NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The aSTEAM Village students, from six different public, charter and private schools, had the opportunity to learn, explore and enjoy an experience of a lifetime in the Chincoteague, Va., and Washington, D.C., areas.</p>
<div id="attachment_881" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/12/SSEP_WallopsB.jpg"><img class="wp-image-881 size-medium" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/12/SSEP_WallopsB-300x179.jpg" alt="SSEP_WallopsB" width="300" height="179" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SSEP Mission 5 Launch Delegation visiting the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. (aSTEAM Village)</p></div>
<p>For several of the students, it was the first time they had ever left the immediate Kansas City area. The highlight of our trip was the visit to the flight facility center where the flight project manager made it his point to host the tour. He spent several hours with the students, teachers and chaperones. What came forth was the utmost and genuine enthusiasm and passion for science and engineering that the individuals and teams of the flight facilities displayed. This experience was so important and it definitely left an unforgettable impression upon both the students and us adults in the Kansas City delegation.</p>
<p>I have been truly amazed to see the realization of the vision of NCESSE director, Jeff Goldstein, Ph.D., and his message to educators, students and parents that, “the world is a classroom.” It is an honor to serve as SSEP Kansas City program director as this program not only has all of us mentors, students and parents looking to the skies and beyond, but it also without question, has inspired the next generation of scientists, technologists and engineers. More importantly, it is infusing the confidence in the student researchers that indeed they can become whatever they want to become, because at a very early age of their life they can truthfully say that participation in SSEP has made them a part of America’s space program.</p>

<p>Seeing these kids take to STEM, NASA can rest assured that SSEP will produce their next wave of talented explorers and leaders. They’ll be ready for hire when NASA ushers our nation deep into the galaxy and beyond over the next century. I know from my experience with these bright and enthusiastic student scientists that they’ll take us great places!</p>
<p>SSEP and its passionate team are a wonderful gift to the younger generation. We need people to challenge the young minds. They indeed are the future. Go, SSEP!</p>

			<p><em>In today’s A Lab Aloft International Space Station Assistant Program Scientist Kirt Costello, Ph.D., lays out what’s new in rodent research in orbit. The updated facility and planned studies will advance capabilities for microgravity life science and biology research.</em></p>
<p>In this blog we often talk about the “why” reasons for the research that we are doing on the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html#.U_ztFRCZiSo">International Space Station</a>, but sometimes it’s also important to talk about “where” NASA gets the ideas. Specifically, where do the concepts and research announcements come from? How does NASA know that the science being selected fits the needs of the country in its quest to get the most beneficial use of the space station’s national laboratory?</p>
<p>Today’s discussion is on the new space station <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1209.html">Rodent Research Facility</a> and the objectives that NASA is trying to meet by making this system available to both researchers seeking safe exploration of space and those seeking improvements in health here on Earth. Many of these investigations directed specifically at improving life on Earth come through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (<a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/">CASIS</a>) as the manager of the space station’s national laboratory resources.</p>
<div id="attachment_866" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/09/Rodent_a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-866" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/09/Rodent_a-300x200.jpg" alt="Image of the Mouse Immunology (MI) Animal Enclosure Modules (AEM). (NASA)" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image of the Mouse Immunology (MI) Animal Enclosure Modules (AEM). (NASA)</p></div>
<p>NASA has been conducting <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/CBTM/">rodent research in space</a> for many years. The majority of those investigations focus on clinical questions about how we keep our astronauts healthy in space for longer periods. They also address very basic life science questions about how animal physiology changes in a weightless environment. Prior to and during the time of station assembly, the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html">Space Shuttle Program</a> hosted the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) studies. The AEM flew 28 missions conducting research, such as the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module or <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/CBTM/">CBTM investigations</a>. The AEM system was well suited to the Space Transportation System (STS), allowing researchers important access to their rodent subjects both before flight and during post flight recovery.</p>
<p>With the end of the shuttle program, it was clear that the use of newly designed <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/index.html#.U_-HkxDiuSo">transportation vehicles</a> would necessitate redesign efforts for AEM use aboard station. Conducting such investigations not on the vehicle, but aboard the station would enable longer-duration studies. The change from a few weeks to a few months in microgravity increases the potential research returns, but also requires some changes in the design of the hardware.</p>

<p>The importance of continuing rodent research aboard the space station is laid out by the National Research Council (NRC) in their 2010 Decadal Study Report, “<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/540620main_April26NACDecadal_508Final.pdf">Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration Life and Physical Sciences Research for a new Era</a>.” In that study’s section on animal and human biology a third of the recommendations specifically called out the use of mouse or animal <a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/11/13/model-organisms-shining-examples-for-simple-effective-biology-research/">model organisms</a> as the mechanism to proceed with research on the orbiting laboratory. These recommendations focus on muscle and bone loss, the testing of drugs for osteoporosis, changes to the animal immune system, the effects of aerosol exposures to the lungs and multi-generational and developmental studies.</p>
<p>To accomplish the wide array of research that the NRC proposed, some improvements were made to the AEM system to update the workhorse that had served well during the shuttle years. Improvements include features such as upgraded longer lasting filters, changeable food trays and support systems within the microgravity science glovebox (MSG) facility. These changes allow for studies to focus on the effects of microgravity exposure over much longer time frames. While the AEM of the shuttle era only housed rodents for up to 17 days, the new facility on space station can maintain an investigation for months.</p>

<p>Part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgBiEgF138">what makes rodents ideal test subjects</a> is the fact that they reach maturity and age much quicker than humans. The typical rodent lifetime is about 2.5 years versus about 72 years for the comparable human. The capability to support rodents for up to 180 day stays is in development for the space station. During stays that long, researchers can begin to investigate questions that deal with developmental biology and extended exposure to microgravity. A half a year stay for a rodent might be the equivalent of a 14 year exposure to a human.</p>
<p>Updates to the old system also add both white light and infrared cameras for observing rodent conditions and behaviors. This capability allows researchers on the ground to closely monitor their studies. It also requires less crew time, as the observations can be done remotely, which in turn frees up that crew time to get more science done aboard the space station.</p>
<p>The first flight of the new Rodent Research Facility is on the upcoming SpaceX-4 mission to the space station. During this flight, designers will validate all of the initial performance goals for the rodent research hardware. The facility also will get a head start on some of the NRC decadal recommended goals with the CASIS sponsored portion of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1824.html">Rodent Research-1</a> investigation. This study will include 10 of the 20 mice flying in the two habitats, and is in partnership with the commercial pharmaceutical company, Novartis.</p>
<div id="attachment_869" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/09/rodent_d.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-869" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/207/2014/09/rodent_d-300x199.jpg" alt="A view of the SpaceX Dragon Commercial Resupply Services-3 (CRS-3) spacecraft grappled by the Canadarm2 Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) during Expedition 39.

<p>The test subjects will live aboard the space station for about 21 days. The CASIS mice will include five wild type—or typical—and five transgenic <a href="http://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.do?id=18503&amp;showAllSites=true">MuRF-1</a> knockout mice. Researchers will compare results from these two groups and the ground control counterparts to determine whether this genetic knockout impacts muscle atrophy and muscle sparing—where tissue is conserved—in those mice.</p>
<p>While the inaugural flight of the new rodent habitat system is right around the bend, the rodent research project team at NASA’s Ames Research Center is already hard at work. They are planning more complex investigations and improving the system to accommodate longer durations and more experimental aims for researchers. Rodent research will become a routine part of space station for the decade to come.</p>
<p>For me, personally, it’s been a great experience working with these teams to get this facility ready for flight. I’m excited by all the possibilities for the new research avenues that this opens for NASA and CASIS researchers. I’m humbled by the effort that has gone into this capability, and I hope you all will tune in during the mission to follow along with the accomplishments of the team.</p>

			<p><em>In today’s A Lab Aloft our guest blogger is Trent Martin, the NASA project manager for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer instrument. Martin shares the challenges and excitement of seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe.</em></p>
<p>Can a single data point make a difference? When speaking of the collected billions of data points since the inception of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 (<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/742.html" target="_blank">AMS-02</a>) to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html#.U8QbqRCiW8A">International Space Station</a> (ISS), the answer is yes. Every data point leads us closer to unveiling the answers to the questions of the universe.</p>
<p>A handful of those unique data points were the topic of the keynote speech delivered by AMS principal investigator Professor Samuel Ting at this year’s ISS Research and Development Conference in Chicago. Approximately 90 percent of the universe is not visible and is called dark matter. Collisions of “ordinary” cosmic rays produce positrons. Collisions of dark matter will produce additional positrons. This excess of positrons has been seen in the AMS data. While more data is needed, this specific handful of points tells us something we didn’t know before about our universe. It adds to our current knowledge and guides us on our path to answers in the areas of dark matter and more.</p>
