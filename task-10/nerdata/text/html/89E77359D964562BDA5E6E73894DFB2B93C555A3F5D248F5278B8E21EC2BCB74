</p>

<h2>3.8  Collect Witness Statements</h2>

<p>
a.  All written witness statements obtained within the first 24 hours of the occurrence of a mishap or close call shall be considered privileged and protected (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44455" target="_blank">Requirement 44455</a>).  Where possible, written witness statements should be collected on a NASA form that includes the statement of privilege as shown in Figure 6.
</p>

<p>
b.  All verbal witness statements and written statements given after 24 hours as part of a NASA mishap investigation, where the witness was explicitly informed that his/her account will not be released, shall be considered privileged and protected (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44457" target="_blank">Requirement 44457</a>). 
</p>

<p>
c.  When privilege has been granted by the IRT, Center safety office, or investigating authority, NASA shall make every effort to keep witness testimony (both written and verbal) confidential and privileged to the greatest extent permitted by law (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44458" target="_blank">Requirement 44458</a>)  This privileged information will be strictly limited to only the information provided directly by the witness for the safety investigation.
</p>

<p>
d.  The witness shall not be given a copy of the privileged written statement or transcripts of verbal witness statements given in the course of a NASA mishap investigation (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44460" target="_blank">Requirement 44460</a>). (If witness statements or transcripts of witness testimony are provided to a witness, NASA cannot ensure that it remains privileged and confidential.)
</p>

<p>
e.  The Center safety office, with the support of the IRT, shall either request initial written statements from all persons who were involved in or witness to the mishap or document verbal accounts from such persons (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44462" target="_blank">Requirement 44462</a>). 
</p>

<p>
f.  Before a verbal witness statement is taken or an interview begins, the IRT, Center safety office, or investigating authority shall tell the witness whether the information gathered during the interview is confidential and privileged or not confidential and not privileged (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44463" target="_blank">Requirement 44463</a>). 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Note:  If the same individual is interviewed multiple times, this should occur each time the individual is interviewed.</em>   
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
g.  When conducting privileged witness interviews, the NASA investigating authority shall only have Federal employees present at the interview (with the exception of the interviewee), unless a contractor has been hired specifically to support interviews or provide technical guidance to the Board during the interviews and has signed a nondisclosure agreement prepared by General Counsel prior to participating in the interviews (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44465" target="_blank">Requirement 44465</a>).</p>

<p>
h.  When it is expected that an external investigating body will be the sole mishap investigation authority (e.g., for catastrophic vehicle failure such as Space Shuttle or International Space Station loss, or airplane loss), NASA shall not grant privilege to witnesses for either written witness statements or verbal witness statements, even when those statements are taken within the first 24 hours after the mishap (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44466" target="_blank">Requirement 44466</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Note: If an outside investigating authority, such as a congressionally appointed mishap investigating board or the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), conducts a mishap investigation for a mishap involving an airplane or catastrophic vehicle loss, they are not required to comply with NPR 8621.1.  Consequently, NASA is unable to ensure that privilege will be maintained and may not be able to withhold privileged statements from the investigation authority.</em> 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
i.  When the IRT, Center safety office, or investigating authority decides to take a verbal statement or interview a witness and keep that witness interview confidential, the interviewer shall read the statement in Figure 6 of this NPR and inform the witness that:
</p>

<p>
(1)  The oral statement (taken during interview) and/or written statement will be retained as part of the investigation report background files but will not be released as part of the mishap report (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44469" target="_blank">Requirement 44469</a>). 
</p>

<p>
(2)  NASA will make every effort to keep the testimony privileged to the greatest extent permitted by law (<a href="http://smarts.grc.nasa.gov/app/reports/dsp_nodis_req_report.cfm?ReqID=44470" target="_blank">Requirement 44470</a>).
